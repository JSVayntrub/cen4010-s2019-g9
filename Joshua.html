I chose it because I knew from a young age that working with computers was a passion of mine and I hope to make a wonderful career with this degree. I love programming. It's fun and challenging, and so many interesting fields are coming about because of it.</p></center></div>

Other interests of mine include gaming. I recently built my first gaming PC and I couldn't be happier. I'm also a huge fan of tv/movie streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.</h4></div>

From there, I hope to find myself in a very interesting subfield that will let me put my passion to work. One area that I believe I will attempt to get my foot in the door in is the Gaming Industry. I have always been passionate about video games just like I have for computer science, so the intermixing of the two would be amazing. I'm also really into the idea of working in Virtual Reality as a potential goal. It's very much in its infancy stage as of right now, but 10-20 years down the line there will be possibilites with it that people today would never be able to imagine.</h4></div>
